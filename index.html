            <p class="card-text">Thanaka (Burmese: သနပ်ခါး; MLCTS: sa. nap hka:; pronounced [θənəkʰá]) is a paste made from ground bark. It is a distinctive feature of the culture of Myanmar, seen commonly applied to the face and sometimes the arms of women and girls, and is used to a lesser extent also by men and boys.Besides its cosmetic use, thanaka also has several practical benefits. The paste acts as a natural sunscreen, protecting the skin from the harsh tropical sun of Myanmar. It also has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which help in keeping the skin cool, preventing acne, and reducing skin irritation.For this reason, Burmese people smear a protective layer of Thanaka over their cheeks, forehead and sometimes from head to toe—an all-natural sunscreen. Thanaka's astringent properties not only improves oily skin, but it also contains menthol which has a cooling and soothing effect.In English, the common names for Limonia acidissima are sandalwood, wood-apple, elephant-apple, monkey fruit, and curd fruit tree. The plant has a number of different names in different languages including bal or bael in Assamese, bael in Bengali, kaitha in Hindi, belingai in Malaysia, and thanaka in Burmese.It is known to protect the skin from the sun as well as to help soothe sunburn. This natural cosmetic is known to keep the skin healthy and young thanks to its many active ingredients and healing properties. It is an antioxidant as well as a moisturizer.</p>

It was made popular by a legendary queen of Beikthano, whose envy-inducing skin was attributed to using the paste. The earliest written reference of it is found in a 14th century poem which is written by a companion of King Razadarit.In the past, thanakha was worn as a natural cosmetic concoction during the period of Myanmar kingdoms. During the monarchy period, lighter and more fragrant thanakha was used for royal families, and it was added with tiny gold powder while commoners used the pollen of flowers named gant gaw (Mesua ferrea).The Origin of Thanakha

For 2000 years, thanakha has been a prominent part of the daily routine for every Burmese women.The history of Thanaka dated from the earliest stages of the country's development for more than 2000 years ago. It is believed that the usage of Thanaka as cosmetics was invented by the legendary queen living in the ruined ancient city during this period.
